# PHY180-REPORTS-DATA
Contains data and programs used to complete PHY180 Reports/Labs.

Programs:
Each python code is for a different graph, the first being quadratic and the second being cosine.

Text Files:
Each text file is referenced in the py files. The text files were changed when searching for ideal theta ranges where C = 0, and therefore not all of the data collected
is represented in each text file.
